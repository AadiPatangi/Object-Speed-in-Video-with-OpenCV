# Object-Speed-in-Video-with-OpenCV

## Ball Speed Calculation Using Image Analysis
### Ping-Pong ball speed is calculated using image analysis.
### Ball speed is analyzed by distance travelled by the ball in captured frames

### Paper scale with one inch incremental lines is prepared
### Ping-Pong ball is hit and the video of the moving ball is captured at 60fps
### Video is transferred to computer and is analyzed using python opencv
### The experiment is repeated 20 times
